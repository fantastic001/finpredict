The day you’ve all been waiting for is finally here. Registration for Disrupt NY 2017 is now open, which means now is your chance to be part of all the Disrupt action for a fraction of the price with extra early bird tickets.
Extra early bird tickets are just $1,795 apiece, saving you $1,200 off the full retail price. You can purchase tickets here. But act fast, because these tickets are only available for a limited time.
That extra early bird ticket includes all the perks of a regular ticket. You’ll get to attend all the lectures and interviews from some of the best and brightest entrepreneurs, investors and innovators around. We’re not ready to share this year’s speakers yet, but you can check out some past Disrupt speakers here.
When you aren’t getting your head filled with knowledge and cool stories from our speakers, you’ll be checking out some amazing early-stage domestic and international startups in Startup Alley and Hardware Alley. Then, you’ll watch a curated selection of startups in the Startup Battlefield competing for the $50,000 grand prize and the coveted Disrupt Cup.
Finally, keep the connections going long into the night by attending the many parties and after-parties that are a staple of the Disrupt experience.
You’re coming to Disrupt either way, right? So you might as well save some cash with an extra early bird ticket.
If you’re a startup, we also have packages to Startup Alley and Hardware Alley available to purchase here, or you can enter for the chance to win one of three demo tables in 12 categories we’re giving away to a few lucky startups (that’s 36 free Startup Alley spots up for grabs) by filling out this form.
Disrupt NY 2017 takes place May 15-17 at Pier 36 in Manhattan, and we can’t wait to see you all there.
