Gadget reviewer Doug Aamoth likes his umbrellas like he likes his women. As such, the $60 Kisha Bluetooth Never Lost Umbrella caught his attention because it’s sturdy and location-trackable via an inexpensive Bluetooth beacon. The Never Lost has bluetooth, not GPS, and can be tracked back to the last location it connected with your phone. So no chase around town to find that pesky umbrella thief, it’s just generally helpful if you are forgetful.
