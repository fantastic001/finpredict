On this week’s episode of Technotopia I talked to Bre Pettis, former CEO of Makerbot and the founder of Bre&Co. Pettis has been thinking about new manufacturing chains, the rise of the local maker, what what happens when a country falls into disrepair.
Pettis is an optimistic realist. He’s been watching Venezuela with great interest and has a few pieces of advice for tech folks who want to try to help out. His takeaway? Start building for the worst case and hope for the best.
